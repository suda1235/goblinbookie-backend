/**
 * Goblin Bookie â€“ Winston Logger Setup
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 *   Configures a unified, timestamped logger for all Goblin Bookie backend scripts.
 *   Every log message (info or error) from the sync pipeline is routed through this Winston logger,
 *   ensuring all output is visible both in the terminal and in the persistent /logs/sync.log file.
 *
 * CONTEXT:
 *   - Used by the logInfo and logError helpers in jsonHelpers.ts (and thus every pipeline script).
 *   - Timestamps and log levels (INFO, ERROR) are included on every line for audit/debugging.
 *   - The /logs directory is auto-created if missing, so logging never fails due to a missing folder.
 *   - Output is always found at project-root/logs/sync.log.
 *
 * CUSTOMIZATION:
 *   - To change log formatting or rotate logs, update this file; all scripts benefit immediately.
 *   - Used for assignment grading, debugging, and production health checks.
