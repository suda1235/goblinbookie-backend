/**
 * Goblin Bookie â€“ NDJSON Sorter
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 *   Reads a newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON) file, parses each line as a JSON object,
 *   sorts all objects alphabetically by their `uuid` field, and writes the sorted objects
 *   back out to a new NDJSON file.
 *
 * CONTEXT:
 *   - Both parsedCards.ndjson and parsedPrices.ndjson must be sorted by UUID before the merge step,
 *     so the merge can happen efficiently as a linear, streaming operation.
 *   - Sorting is done in memory (safe for pre-filtered files <1GB, as on Render's 2GB limit).
 *
 * ERROR HANDLING:
 *   - Lines that cannot be parsed as valid JSON are logged and skipped (no crash).
 *   - Summary logs total, skipped, and output path at the end.
