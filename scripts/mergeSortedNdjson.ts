/**
 * Merge Sorted NDJSON
 *
 * Purpose:
 * This script performs a memory-efficient merge join of two large, pre-sorted NDJSON files:
 *
 * - cardsSorted.ndjson: Sorted card metadata (uuid, name, setCode, etc.)
 * - pricesSorted.ndjson: Sorted price data (uuid â†’ prices object)
 *
 * Output:
 * - mergedCards.ndjson: Each line is a merged JSON object combining card metadata and its corresponding prices,
 *   matched by UUID.
 *
 * Why use this approach:
 * - Both input files are sorted by UUID, so we can process them in a single linear pass.
 * - We use readline streams and async iterators to handle one line at a time, keeping memory usage very low.
 * - Avoids the need to build a map or load an entire file into memory, which would be unsafe for large datasets.
 *
 * Implementation details:
 * - Each stream is advanced independently, comparing UUIDs lexicographically to find matching pairs.
 * - Only writes output for UUIDs present in both files; unmatched cards or prices are skipped.
 * - Uses a waitForStreamFinish utility to guarantee all output is flushed before exiting.
