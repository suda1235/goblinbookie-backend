/**
 * Goblin Bookie â€“ Cleanup Script
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 *   Deletes all temporary files in /temp generated during the sync pipeline,
 *   except for a single `.keep` file (which ensures the directory is retained in Git).
 *
 * CONTEXT:
 *   - The sync process creates large NDJSON files (parsed, sorted, merged) in /temp.
 *   - Deleting them after each run prevents disk bloat and keeps the working directory tidy.
 *   - The `.keep` file is intentionally preserved so /temp remains in version control.
 *   - All logs use [cleanUp.ts] as the tag for easy traceability.
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
 *   - Reads all files in /temp with fs.promises.readdir.
 *   - Deletes all except `.keep` in parallel with Promise.all.
 *   - Logs each deletion and a summary, or any errors encountered.
